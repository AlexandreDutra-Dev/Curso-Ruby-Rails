Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects 
and their interactions to design and program applications.

Allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks
independently of other areas in the application.

Encapsulation - concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it
available to the rest of the program

Abstraction - is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise
software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it

Inheritance - is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class,
referred to as the superclass

Polymorphism - is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, but has
the ability to not inherit everything and change some of it's inherited 
behaviors. For example to write a method that does something differently from 

Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the
objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects.
Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular
class. 

Example of a User class:
class User
  attr_accessor :name, :email

  def initialize(name, email)
    @name = name
    @email = email
  end

  def run
    puts "Hey I am a class method"
  end

  def self.identify_yourself
    puts "Hey I am a class method"
  end
end
user = User.new("Dave", "dave@example.com")
user.run
User.identify_yourself

Examples:
  University

  Student
    students - first name, last name, email, student id

  Course
    courses - course name, course description, course id

  
  Bookstore

  Book
    books - ISBN, name, description

  Employee
    employees - SSN, first name, last name, email, employee id

Use case for student class - Authentication systems in web applications
For now think of students as users
Done with usernames and passwords
Security for user information very important
Passwords are virtually never stored in their string forms
Hashed digests are stored in the db's 
A popular hashing algorithm is MD5 - bcrypt
Creates a hash digest of the string
